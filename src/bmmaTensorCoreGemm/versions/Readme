Basic imma code from CUDA SDK without modification.

1:
Clean up imma code. Will implement bmma from here.

2:
An initial attempt. Still some bugs.
CUDA error at bmmaTensorCoreGemm.cu:418 code=700(cudaErrorIllegalAddress) "cudaEventSynchronize(stop)"

3:
SHMEM and BMMA seems to be correct. Writing back to D is still being developed.

4:
Add writing back to D. Have all workloads (e.g., read, compute, write). Can compile and run. Speed is 400TOPS.
2x faster than Li Ang's BMMASN-Bin (~200TOPS, on a matrix of MxNxK: 8192x8192x65536). 4x faster than Li Ang's BMMA_bin implementation (~120TOPS).

Overall, the kernel takes 21 ms (404TOPS).
Loading from GL takes 9 ms. 
BMMA takes 1.2 ms. [去除这块，有918TOPS]
Writing back to SHMEM takes 6 ms. [去除这块，有787TOPS]
Writing back to GL takes 5 ms. [去除这块，有528TOPS]

Note:
    a. The address of writing back to D has not been carefully checked.
    b. The correctness of the result is not validated.
    c. The performance may still be improved. E.g., i) Increase the block size; (ii) reduce the GL write according to the required number of bits in the workload.

5:
This version should be logically correct. It can also compile and run without any errors or warnings.
This version is 520 TOPS, since some memory access errors are corrected.

The correctness of the result is not validated yet.


6:
Add validation code.

The computation results is not correct.
