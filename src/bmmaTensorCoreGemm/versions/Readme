Basic imma code from CUDA SDK without modification.

1:
Clean up imma code. Will implement bmma from here.

2:
An initial attempt. Still some bugs.
CUDA error at bmmaTensorCoreGemm.cu:418 code=700(cudaErrorIllegalAddress) "cudaEventSynchronize(stop)"

3:
SHMEM and BMMA seems to be correct. Writing back to D is still being developed.
